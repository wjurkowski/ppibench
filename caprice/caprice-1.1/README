caprice QA

1) CAPRI like protein complex quality assessment for model and real structures


  Run:
	perl ../caprice7/caprice7.pl brugel [native contacts] [model contacts] [native pdb]  [model pdb] lrms
	
	Requirements:
		PDB format
			Both pdb should have unique chain identifiers.
		Library path
			update PERL5LIB to point the modules e.g in bash: export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/usr/local/caprice7/Modules

  About:
	Program compares protein complexes by calculation of contacts and RMSD
	Contacts below 5Å. Required: list of native contacts, list of predicted contacts
	fnat = predicted native contacts/native contacts
	fnonnat = non native contacts/all contacts predicted

	Residues within 5Å cutoff
	fil = native residues found /all residues 
	fir_l - residues in ligand
	fir_r - residues in receptor

	RMS of ligands. Alignment of receptors and RMS calculated for ligands
	L_rms = rms of ligands

	RMS of interface.
	contacts < 10Å selected, backbones aligned and rms calculated 
	l_rms = rms of interface

	Qualty levels:
	HIGH		fnat >= 0.5 AND (L_rms <= 1.0 OR I_rms <=1.0)
	MEDIUM		0.5 > fnat >= 0.3 AND (L_rms <= 5.0 OR I_rms <=2.0)
			fnat >= 0.5 AND L_rms > 1.0 AND I_rms >1.0
	ACCEPTABLE	0.3 > fnat >= 0.1 AND (L_rms <= 10.0 OR I_rms<=4.0)
			fnat >= 0.3 AND L_rms > 5.0 AND I_rms>2.0
	INCORRECT	fnat < 0.1 OR (L_rms > 10.0 AND I_rms<=4.0)			

2) conservation based score of models

  Run:
	perl caprice.pl score contacts conserv_rec conserv_lig
