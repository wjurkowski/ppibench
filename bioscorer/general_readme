Title: readme file for double wrapper, bioscorer, etc.

What on earth is an .atf file?
	The name .atf stands for Atom Triangle Frequencies. An .atf file
	is a 455x13 matrix that counts the number of times a certain atom
	group type to triangle type contact has been observed in a given
	dataset of interfaces.

What is a .join.atf file?
	A .join.atf file is an .atf file for an interface...what???
		As the whole pipeline looks now, I create one .atf file per
		direction. Here is an example: say that we have an interface
		between chain A and chain B. To count the atom to triangle
		contacts for this interface, we have to take atoms on A against
		triangles on B, and then atoms on B against triangles on A. See
		These two cases as two directions, A to B and B to A. And so,
		for each direction, I create one .atf file. Then, the join...pl
		script joins pairs of .atf files corresponding to the same chain
		pairs into .join.atf files.

Where is the juicy juice?
	Well, our important model is built on the information from the
	native interfaces, and this information is stored in a huge .atf
	file called native.2009.atf. We also have a file called native.2008.atf
	which is the old knowledge base.

Loads and loads of files, what to do, what to do?
	.pdb, atom...pdb, atom...chain...pdb, .atom, .cross, .atf, .join.atf

	For a dataset of 1000 .pdb files, you get the following situation

	.pdb				1000
	atom...pdb			1000
	atom...chain...pdb	2000
	.atom				2000
	.cross				2000
	.atf				2000
	.join.atf			1000
---------------------------------
	Total				11000

During a longer run, it is useful to keep .atom and .cross files, in case
something goes wrong and the run dies before the list is finished. A good
way of cleaning a directory when everything is finished is to keep only
the .join.atf files as results. So far, I did not write any clean up
script.
